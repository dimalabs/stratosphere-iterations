/**
 * The base interface for normalizable keys. Normalizable keys can create a binary representation
 * of themselves that is byte-wise comparable. The byte-wise comparison of two normalized keys 
 * proceeds until all bytes are compared or two bytes at the corresponding positions are not equal.
 * If two corresponding byte values are not equal, the lower byte value indicates the lower key.
 * If both normalized keys are byte-wise identical, the actual key may have to be looked at to
 * determine which one is actually lower.
 * <p>
 * The latter depends on whether the normalized key covers the entire key or is just a prefix of the
 * key. A normalized key is considered a prefix, if its length is less than the maximal normalized
 * key length.
