/**
 * Describes the base interface that is used describe an input that produces records that are processed
 * by stratosphere.
 * <p>
 * The input format handles the following:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>It describes how the input is split into splits that can be processed in parallel.</li>
 *   <li>It describes how to read records from the input split.</li>
 *   <li>It describes how to gather basic statistics from the input.</li> 
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The life cycle of an input format is the following:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>After being instantiated (parameterless), it is configured with a {@link Configuration} object. 
 *       Basic fields are read from the configuration, such as for example a file path, if the format describes
 *       files as input.</li>
 *   <li>Optionally: It is called by the compiler to produce basic statistics about the input.</li>
 *   <li>It is called to create the input splits.</li>
 *   <li>Each parallel input task creates an instance, configures it and opens it for a specific split.</li>
 *   <li>All records are read from the input</li>
 *   <li>The input format is closed</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * IMPORTANT NOTE: Input formats must be written such that an instance can be opened again after it was closed. That
 * is due to the fact that the input format is used for potentially multiple splits. After a split is done, the
 * format's close function is invoked and, if another split is available, the open function is invoked afterwards for
 * the next split.
 *  
 * @see InputSplit
 * @see BaseStatistics
 * 
 * @param <T> The type of input split.
