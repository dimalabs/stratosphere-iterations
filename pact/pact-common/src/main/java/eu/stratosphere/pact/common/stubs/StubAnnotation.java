/**
 * This class defines the PACT annotations, realized as java annotations. To use
 * a PACT annotation, simply add the annotation above the class declaration of
 * the class that realized the user function. For example, to declare the <i>ReadSet</i> 
 * annotation for a map-type function that realizes a simple filter,
 * use it the following way:
 * 
 * <pre><blockquote>
 * \@ReadSet(fields={2})
 * public class MyMapper extends MapStub
 * {
 *     public void map(PactRecord record, Collector out)
 *     {
 *        String s = record.getField(2, PactString.class).toString();
 *        
 *        if (s.contains("...some text...") {
 *            out.collect(record);
 *        }Reduce
 *     }
 * }
 * </blockquote></pre>
 * 
 * Be aware that some annotations should only be used for stubs with as single input 
 * ({@link MapStub}, {@link ReduceStub}) and some only for stubs with two inputs 
 * ({@link CrossStub}, {@link MatchStub}, {@link CoGroupStub}).
